Lessons learned with BDD tutorial code
======================================

Lessons learned with BDD tutorial code - Cucumber JVM, selenium WebDriver, page objects, and a little FitNesse

This code supports the Tutorial "Lessons Learned With BDD"

http://www.slideshare.net/eviltester/lessons-learned-with-bdd-a-tutorial

It contains examples of:

* Selenium WebDriver
* Maven
* Page Objects
* Cucumber

The original tutorial also had FitNesse examples. I have left the code for this
in the code base. The wiki page is in the comments for the FitNesse Fixture.
I have not included the wiki or FitNesse in the code base.

The code is not fully refactored or perfect, it is shown in different stages of refactoring.

The code is intended for private study. Please do not use it for commercial training, or
in public videos, or in books etc. If you want to re-use it commercially then please
contact me to agree licensing.
